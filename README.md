## Abstract
Bulky tumors remain difficult to treat, and trials combining immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) with conventional radiotherapy (RT) have shown limited success. To treat bulky tumor, we developed **EclipseRT (ERT)**, a novel RT technique that delivers low-dose radiotherapy (LDRT) to the gross tumor volume (GTV) while stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) to subvolume(s) of the GTV. ERT leverages the immunogenic effects of SBRT and the immunomodulatory effects of LDRT, enabling it as a promising partner for ICIs (iERT). In three mouse tumor models, iERT promoted significant bulky tumor control via natural killer (NK) and CD8+ T cells. ScRNA-seq and validation experiments demonstrated that iERT, particularly the SBRT component, induces type I interferon (IFN-I), activating NK cells that secrete XCL1 which recruits cross-presenting XCR1+ dendritic cells (DCs) into the tumor microenvironment. SBRT also generates extracellular vesicles carrying neoantigens, which are delivered to DCs. These DCs, with high antigen processing/presentation capacity, drive strong CD8+ T cell responses. The LDRT component promoted NK and CD8+ T-cell recruitment. Additionally, iERT induces precursors of exhausted CD8+ T cells in both tumor and tumor-draining lymph nodes. Collectively, iERT activates the **IFN-I/NK/DC/CD8+ T cell axis**, triggering a viral mimicry response to boost antitumor immunity.
